An [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg) library for Dart.

Created specifically for [ArchipelaButt](https://codeberg.org/ShoresForgotten/archipelabutt). As a consequence, the functionality of this library is focused on the needs of ArchipelaButt. If somebody else makes use of this library, please let me know and I'll be more careful about updates.
